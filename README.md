# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

So I've done all of the requirements and added the deleting messages option for the personal touch. So first of all, you can easily run the project just by running run.sh file. application.py includes all of the functions of my application and it is linked to templates folder that contains my index.html file and static folder which holds all of my styling, scripts and images that are used in the project like style.scss and script.js which are my main files for running the project. Hope you like it thanks a lot for your consideration.
